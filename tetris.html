				<h2>SVG Tetris Clone</h2>
				<p>My first ever big project with SVG, it was an assignment for a web design class. As the story goes, it was finals week, and I
				had just finished the rest of my projects. This one, being due last, was pushed to the back of the queue, and now I had 7 hours to bring this project from what was only
				a title screen that could transfer to the playing field, to a fully working Tetris clone. This was despite having very little prior exposure to SVG, having never attempted
				to program a game in Javascript, and having never even attempted to make a Tetris clone before.</p>
				
				<p>After 7 straight hours of work, with only a minimal break for dinner, this was the result. There are some prominent bugs, but overall I'm very proud of it, when all things are considered.
				Especially seeing as if I had even an hour or two more time, I could've fixed those bugs. I've chosen not to adjust the game any since the initial submission so that you can see exactly what I can do
				with 7 hours' worth of work time to panic through.</p>
				
				<p>The game was programmed primarily using Javascript, with some HTML and CSS, and SVG was used for the graphics.</p>
