    <h4>SVG Tetris Clone</h4>
    <p>Be the one who arranges the blocks, as you play yet another port of a classic that has probably been ported to every
    platform that exists!</p>
    
    <p>My first ever big project with SVG, it was an assignment for a web design class. Written in JavaScript in mostly one stretch of about 7 hours time.</p>
    
    <p>The game was programmed primarily using Javascript, with some HTML and CSS, and SVG was used for the graphics.</p>
