				<h2>Motorola 68000 Disassembler</h2>
				<p>One dream of mine as a kid was to make a game for the Sega Genesis, as it was my favorite console at the time.
				Upon discovering that the Genesis used the Motorola 68000 processor (henceforth 'the 68k'), I decided to start learning its assembly language.
				It was a good motivator for picking up assembly language, and helped me learn quite a lot about the workings of a processor.</p>
				
				<p>At one point, I decided that one really good way to both test my knowledge of the language and to learn more about it (as well as the Genesis) would be to try disassembling a game
				to study it. However, I had trouble finding any disassemblers that were free to use (I'm a college student on a tight budget). So, I did what anyone
				in my situation would've, and made my own!</p>
				
				<p>Its current functionality consists of blindly parsing a file's data into 68k instructions to be output to another file.
				One can input a decimal starting and ending address if they don't want to parse the whole file in one go. I intend on adding more features as I go.</p>
				
				<p>The disassembler was developed in C++, with no external libraries, for the command line. It is made to be compatible with the Asm68k Assembler.</p>
				
				<p>This was a solo project, done entirely in my free time, of my own will and desire.</p>
