		<h4>Motorola 68000 Disassembler</h4>
		<p>A program that converts raw binary data into readable Motorola 68000 assembly code. I'm getting into Sega Genesis homebrew
		development in my free time, and thus had a need to learn how to program for its processor, the M68k. So, I wrote this disassembler
		with the hopes of solidifying my knowledge of its assembly language in the process.</p>
		
		<p>Its current functionality consists of blindly parsing a file's data into 68k instructions to be output to another file.
		One can input a decimal starting and ending address if they don't want to parse the whole file in one go. I intend on adding more features as I go.</p>
		
		<p>The disassembler was developed in C++, with no external libraries, for the command line. It is made to be compatible with the Asm68k Assembler.</p>
		
		<p>This was a solo project, done entirely in my free time, of my own will and desire.</p>
