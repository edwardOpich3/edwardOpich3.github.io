		<h4>Save Mary</h4>
		<p>Mary is a young up-and-coming investigative journalist! She was looking into some shady dealings
		going on around a certain construction company, when the CEO had her thrown in a canyon set to flood and drown her!
		Take on the role of the crane operator who stumbled upon the helpless woman, and stack blocks to help save her from a 
		watery grave!</p>
		
		<p>Save Mary is a clone of the ultimately scrapped Atari game of the same name. I created it for a class in 2017
		alongside a team. The other members were Sharlene Mendez, Nicole Griffin, Andrew Harding, Parker Wilson, and Nicholas Zonenberg.</p>
		
		<p>I was tasked with programming the behavior of the blocks, the water, Mary's drowning state, and Mary's saved state / the win state.
		In addition, I also composed the background music.</p>
		
		<p>The game was developed using the Unity engine, with C# as the scripting language.</p>
