		<h4>Neon Rift</h4>
		<p>Jax Rocksalot is the keytarist of the band Neon Rift, playing a smash of a concert... <em>in space!</em>
		The crowd is getting out of control, but the show must go on! Play as Jax as you dodge bottles and keep the fans
		at bay with the sheer power of rock and roll!</p>
		
		<p>Neon Rift was created for a class in 2017 by a team of people, including myself.
		The other members were Sharlene Mendez, Nicole Griffin, Andrew Harding, Parker Wilson, and Nicholas Zonenberg.</p>
		
		<p>I was tasked with composing the music, programming the bullet notes to match with the song,
		programming the movement of the thrown bottles, creating the intro scene, and some polish regarding animations and
		responsive design for different resolutions.</p>
		
		<p>The game was developed using the Unity engine, with C# as the scripting language.</p>
