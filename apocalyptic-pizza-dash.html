		<h4>Apocalyptic Pizza Dash</h4>
		<p>It's the zombie apocalypse, but that won't stop <em>this</em> pizza shop from meeting its 30-minute guarantee!
		Enter the shoes of the shop's trusted pizza delivery girl as you rush to make your route on time, while fighting off zombies
		with nothing but a spatula! Don't take too long; the zombies come out in droves past sun-down!</p>
		
		<p>Apocalyptic Pizza Dash was a game I made with some friends/classmates as a project for a class in 2016.
		We were assigned the task of designing and developing a video game from the ground up, and completing it within a semester.
		This is the result of that assignment.</p>
		
		<p>My efforts were devoted to architecting the code, and doing a lot of gameplay programming; I am responsible for getting climbing, attacking,
		jumping, and scrolling the screen working properly, as well as programming the interactions between objects.</p>
		
		<p>The game was developed using the MonoGame library with C#.</p>
		
		<p>The team consisted of myself, Christopher Schiff, Eleanor Post, and Isabella Verbraak.</p>
