		<h4>Unity Autonomous Agents Demo</h4>
		<p>Welcome to the not-so-distant future! It's a lovely time, where things look exactly like they do now. Except there are robots!
		And slightly more advanced technology! Wow!</p>
		
		<p>This was my final project for a class in the fall of 2016. I was required to make a scene, with various autonomous agents
		within it, such as: agents with a flocking behavior (the drones), agents with a pathfinding behavior (the drones and the lead robot),
		and agents with a leader-following behavior (the following robots).</p>
		
		<p>The scene was made in Unity. The assets aren't my own, only the code is. There is a document crediting the asset creators in the
		downloadable zip file.</p>
