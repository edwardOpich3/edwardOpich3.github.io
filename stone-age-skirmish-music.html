		<h4>Stone Age Skirmish Sound</h4>
		<p>Alongside the graphical assets for Stone Age Skirmish, SFX were also required.
		BGM was optional, but I opted to include it anyway.</p>
		
		<p>Here is the list of SFX and the one song from the game.</p>
		
		<p>Player shooting SFX</p>
		<audio controls><source src="audio/player.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
		
		<p>Enemy shooting SFX</p>
		<audio controls><source src="audio/enemy.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
		
		<p>Hit player/enemy SFX</p>
		<audio controls><source src="audio/boom.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
		
		<p>BGM</p>
		<audio controls><source src="audio/music.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
		
		<p>The music was made in Synthfont, using the Arachno soundfont.</p>
		<p>The SFX were all obtained from free sources.</p>
