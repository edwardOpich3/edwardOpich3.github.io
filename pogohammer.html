    <h4>Pogohammer</h4>
    <p>A 3D Model of the Pogohammer, one of the weapons of choice for John Egbert, of Homestuck fame.
    The model was made as an assignment for a class, and is my first serious attempt at creating a 3D model.</p>
    <p>The pogohammer was modeled in Maya, with textures created using GIMP, Mudbox for the normal map,
    and mental-ray for the ambient occlusion.</p>
