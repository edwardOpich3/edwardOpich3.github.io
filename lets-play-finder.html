		<h4>Let's Play Finder</h4>
		<p>A web app that uses the functionality of the GiantBomb API and the Youtube Data API to provide the service of finding a let's play
		of a particular game.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, one can search up a game by title through GiantBomb, and then proceed to its GiantBomb page, or click on a button to start a Youtube search
		for a Let's Play. From there, the user can either go straight to any of the Let's Plays found, or go to the channel that created them.</p>
		
		<p>The app was written in JavaScript, using jQuery for handling JSONP.</p>
		
		<p>The app was made for a web development class in the Spring of 2018.</p>
