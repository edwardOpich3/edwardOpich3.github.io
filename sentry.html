    <h4>The Trip of the Sentry</h4>
    <p>Never take a nap near a crumbling ledge. That's what the sentry learned as he woke up at the bottom of the cliff, a good story or two below his post.
    Now, take control as he traverses the tedious and trap-filled path back to the temple!</p>
    
    <p>The Trip of the Sentry was a game I made on my own for a web development class in the Spring of 2018.
    It was developed entirely in JavaScript, using Canvas for display, and XMLHttpRequests for level loading.</p>
