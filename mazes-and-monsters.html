				<h4>Mazes &amp; Monsters</h4>
				<p>You've stumbled upon an ancient, towering structure filled to the brim with ultra-rare playing cards for one of your favorite games!
				But the tower is <em>also</em> crawling with monsters from the game who would love a good snack! Dare to grab as many cards as you can while fending
				off the monsters and keeping yourself in one piece!</p>
				<p>Mazes and Monsters was my second big attempt at designing and developing a game, back in 2014.
				I created the game in my free time, and solo; all assets and programming were done by me. The game is a Pac-man clone,
				with a bit of creative liberty taken, as well as sporting a Sega Master System inspired aesthetic in its artwork, music, and SFX.</p>
				<p>The game is mostly finished, however I ended up moving on to bigger and better things before I implemented difficulty increases and other features.</p>
				<p>The game was programmed using the Allegro graphics library with C++. Artwork was made in GIMP. The music and SFX was made using the Deflemask tracker.</p>
