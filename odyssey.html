    <h4>Odyssey</h4>
    <p>Enter the shoes of Slas, a merc-for-hire who gets himself into all sorts of situations in this sci-fi adventure.
    Shoot, run, and punch your way to victory! Or, sneak around and try to take your enemies by surprise. It's all up to you.</p>
    <p>Odyssey was the Second Place winner of the 2018 New York State Game Dev Challenge, in the Student category.</p>
    <p>I joined the project in January of 2018, as lead programmer.
    The project was started by our Project Manager and development generalist, Alexander Woodward, back in 2017. The rest of the team consists of
    Level Designer Stephen Callen, and Audio Engineer Justin Levine.</p>
    <p>The game was programmed using the Unity engine, in C#. It is still under development, and thus not available for play currently.</p>
