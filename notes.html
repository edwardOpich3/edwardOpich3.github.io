    <p>All images, scripts, and the site's unique CSS
    were created by me. The font used in the header is 'Press Start 2P', found on Google Fonts.</p>
    
    <p>The CSS Framework is Skeleton. The changes I made include changing the base font, 
    changing the default colors on links, and changing the default color on the font.</p>
    
    <p>I'm sure there are plenty of ways to improve the site; someone with more of an eye
    for design might think up a better color palette, or add some flourishes to the CSS to
    really make the site pop, like some shadows or some strategically placed divs and rounded edges.
    But through and through, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!</p>
