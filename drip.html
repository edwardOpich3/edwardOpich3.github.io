    <h4>Drip Game</h4>
    <p>You're a drip of paint, sliding down a wall. You don't know where you started. You don't know why. You don't know when you'll stop.
    You do know, however, that you don't <em>want</em> to stop. Slide as far as you can down different walls, dodging obstacles,
    and grabbing powerups all the while!</p>
    
    <p>Drip Game is a game I started on my own in 2017, that is currently still in development. No demo is currently available.</p>
    
    <p>The game serves many purposes, being my first attempt at a game targeted to mobile devices, and testing out the
    Allegro library's mobile capabilities.</p>
    
    <p>The game was developed using the Allegro library, in C++.</p>
