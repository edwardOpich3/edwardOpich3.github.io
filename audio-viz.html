    <h4>Audio Visualizer</h4>
    <p>This Audio Visualizer can play one of 3 tracks, and visualize its waveform via the bass guitar view, or its
    frequencies via the amplifier view. There are various effects that can be activated to change the experience up.</p>
    
    <p>The program was written in JavaScript, using Canvas for visuals, and Web Audio for handling audio data. It was made
    for a web development class in the Spring of 2018.</p>
