			<h2>About</h2>
			<div class="about">
				<p>I chose to make this site because I am very passionate about Smash Bros! I've been playing since around 2001,
				and figured that it would be pretty cool to write a tutorial on learning to play at a higher level,
				or at least as high as I am.</p>
				
				<p>The information from this site was pulled directly out of my own experience.</p>
				<p>The images on the site are from Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, by Nintendo.</p>
