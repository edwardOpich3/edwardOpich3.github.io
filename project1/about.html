			<h2>About</h2>
			<div class="about">
				<p>	I chose this topic because I am very passionate about Smash Bros!
				I've been playing since around 2001, and figured that it would be pretty cool to write an in-depth tutorial on learning to play at a higher level, or at least as high as I am.</p>
				
				<p>Haven't really done anything that would qualify as "Above and Beyond" for the page yet.</p>
				<p>The CSS file seems way more convoluted than it probably needs to be.
				Also for some reason the font size on this page is larger than the main page?
				No idea why that's happening cause I set them to be the same.</p>
				<p>The information from this site was pulled directly out of my own experience.</p>
				<p>The images on the site are from Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, by Nintendo.</p>
