    <h4>Mode 7 Shader</h4>
    <p>This program was written to test out a shader I wrote to try and simulate the specific pseudo-perspective
    effect used in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game, Super Mario Kart, and thus uses some of its graphics to show its accuracy.</p>
    
    <p>The program was written in C++ using the Allegro 5 library, and using HLSL for the shader.
    It was written over the course of about a month. I then ported it to GLSL over the course of a day.</p>
