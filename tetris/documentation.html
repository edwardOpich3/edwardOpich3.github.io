			<h1>Edward Opich's Project 3 Documentation</h1>
			<h2>How the project was created</h2>
			<p>When it comes to creating the project, I was extremely basic. I used svg, javascript, html, and some css. I didn't use any libraries. All of the source was written by me, however I did get some inspiration from the original Tetris on the Game Boy for game mechanics like scoring and leveling, as well as from looking at the source of <a href="http://codedread.com/yastframe.php">this</a> tetris game to get a feel for how I should implement my tetromino definitions.</p>
			
			<h2>Skills that were used</h2>
			<p>One skill I needed to learn to make this project work was being able to stay on target for hours at a time (at the time of writing I have worked on this project for 7 hours straight today!). Small periods of work over an extended period of time will get the project done, but during this 7 hour period I managed to get more accomplished than countless smaller work sessions I've had previously.</p>
			
			<p>A lot of the other skills I needed for this project were skills that I already had, but they were certainly worked! Some examples were my foresight, in implementing the structures for features I wanted to have ahead of time so I didn't have to go out of my way later (pretty much everything having to do with the HUD and difficulty), and some abstract mathematical thinking to figure out how to turn a 1-dimensional array into a Tetris game board, as well as figuring out the best way to implement the tetrominoes.</p>
			
			<h2>Areas for improvement</h2>
			<p>This project has plenty that can be fixed and improved. As it stands, it could use some music to liven the mood a bit. I've yet to implement the localStorage API at the time of writing. Also, though I haven't had the time to thoroughly test it I'm certain there are plenty of bugs to fix.</p>
			
			<h2>A final note:</h2>
			<p>This is easily among the biggest portfolio pieces I feel I've ever made, thanks for giving me a good motivation to make this thing!</p>
